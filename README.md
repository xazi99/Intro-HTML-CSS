WHAT IS HTML?

UNIT2
#Taxt formatting and Syntax
HTML is a standard markup language usedto stracture web pages.It uses tags meaning it uses less than and greather than(><). We have two types of tags which are Opening tags <h> and closing tags </h>. In most cases the tags work together to define elements.Most important purpose for HTML is that it gives meaning of the content and help cumputers understand it.

#HTML ELEMENTS
#NESTED HTLM ELEMENTS & HTML PARAGRAPHS
We are a DOM tree stands for Document Object Model.
On HTML paragraphs we use tags to separate the paragraphs,when starting a paragraph we use an opening tag<p> then we end with a closng tag</p>.

#HTML HEADLINES
They help people to understand the page structure, also they can be the main content. They also act as a title that attract readers for more information. There are six elemets used for marking headlines(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)
The first element(h1) is the largest one while h6 is the small one and is not important, the rest of the elements fall in between in the orderof importance.

#HTML BOLD AND ITALICS
There are two elements for Bold and two elements for etalic. When we italicize a word we want it to have a strong meaning.
We use (<i>) element to italics and (<em>) element to emphasize, the are two elements in HTML that make a word or phrase Bold or Emphasize. We use <strong> element to show that something is important and serious and we use (<b>) element to make the phrase bold.

#HTML LISTS
We have three tyoes of lists, the are Ordered lists, un-ordered lists and definition lists. Unorderd lits are used everyday, they are enclosed with <li> element that represent that they are a list item and they are wrapoed with (<ul>) element that shows that this is an unoedred list.
On orderd list we use (<ol>) to wrap the entire list which shows that the list is ordered.
Definition list it is used to create list that resembles a key-value. They use specific elements, a term is enclosed in a <dt> tag stands for definition term. The description term is enclosed in a (<dd>) tag which stands for definition description. The entire list s wrapped up by a (<dl>) tag which stand for a definiion list.

#HTML QOUTES
On qoutes we enclose the paragraph with a (<p>) tag and we then make the qoute differ or other text with <blockqoute> element that will wrap the entired thing.
We have (<cite>) and <blockqoute> elements that notify other computers about a additinal information.
On HTML we use <q> element which stands for qoute and the browser automatically provide the right qoute mark.The are also block-level elements.

DATE ELEMENT
HTML uses this element to to set date and time in a way that computers will understand. 
Syntax <time datetime="2024-01-12">January 12,2024</time>. Date and time have their specific format that machines can understand and as programmer we need to use them.

#HTML DATE AND TIME INPUTS
HTML use this single element <time>, this element is used to mark anything that specifies time,date,day,and duration. The is also a closing tag </time>.
In between the tags we use a readable human format.

#HTML CODE,PRE AND BR
HTML signs "&lt" which represent a less than sign and "&gt" that represent a greater than sign.
The br element is added at the end of each line, it is a simple tag without opening and closing tags. Pre and Code are combined in most cases to display block codes.

#HTML Superscripts,Subscripts and Small text
They are used to mark up certain bits of a content that you want it to have a different meaning than the rest of the content.
Subscripts are charactors that are normally set below the baseline for a text.Superscript are charactors that are set above the baseline of a text.

#UNIT 3
HTML CAPABILITIES
Troubleshooting and Debugging HTLM 
When writing a code and accidentally made a mistake the Dom will make the results to have extra because it believes that the should be an extra tag.
HTML ATTRIBUTES
The datetime attribute is used only to the time element,other attributes work with multiple elements but not all of them.Syntax for class attribute <p class="intro"> then the end tag </p>.
Syntax for Id attribute <p class="intro"id="article-intro"> then the end tag </p>.

GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES

Mostly used attribute is Class attribute and it allow to assign reusable name to any element, which can be styled using CSS.

ID attribute it is similar to the class attribute but we can only use unique and can be used for CSS targeting that are more specific and sometimes can cause issues.
Content editable attribute allow visitors to adit the content on the web page.

Lang attribute allow to specify the language of a content using short language code.

Dir attribute shows the direction on which the text flows using Left-to-right(LTR) script and Right-to-left(RTL) script.

Lang and dir are considered are global attributes and can be used to HTML attributes.

ARIA ROLES

They are extra attributes that can be added on HTML elements to make them more meaningful and and help browsers to understand what they represent.They came about when the web began and replace vative applications
It is a powerful used tool that greately enhances web accessibiity.

FORMATTING HTML

Comments are inserted by typing "<!--" at the start and type this "-->" at the end. The length of an element give the clue of how long it has been on existence. Some older elements have no closing tags while the new ones have both the opening and a closing tag.

UNUSUAL CHARACTERS

The symbol <,>,& are important characters of HTML. If we write them with spaces inbetween they become the real content. Non-breaking space has a unique role in Html,spaces in the text allow lines to break and words remain intact.

Non-breaking space also tell the browser not to break the lines between two words. It also create multiple spaces between te words.


#UNIT 4
HTML NAVIGATION AND LINKING
HTML LINKS
When creating a link we use an A element which stand for ancher,we add a href attribute with the URL enclosed on qoutes.The URL will take us to the link and the href stands for HyperText Reference
