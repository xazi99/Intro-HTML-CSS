#Taxt formatting and Syntax
HTML is a standard markup language usedto stracture web pages.It uses tags meaning it uses less than and greather than(><). We have two types of tags which are Opening tags <h> and closing tags </h>. In most cases the tags work together to define elements.Most important purpose for HTML is that it gives meaning of the content and help cumputers understand it.
#HTML ELEMENTS
#NESTED HTLM ELEMENTS & HTML PARAGRAPHS
We are a DOM tree stands for Document Object Model.
On HTML paragraphs we use tags to separate the paragraphs,when starting a paragraph we use an opening tag<p> then we end with a closng tag</p>.
#HTML HEADLINES
They help people to understand the page structure, also they can be the main content. They also act as a title that attract readers for more information. There are six elemets used for marking headlines(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)
The first element(h1) is the largest one while h6 is the small one and is not important, the rest of the elements fall in between in the orderof importance.

#HTML BOLD AND ITALICS
There are two elements for Bold and two elements for etalic. When we italicize a word we want it to have a strong meaning.
We use <i> element to italics and <em> element to emphasize, the are two elements in HTML that make a word or phrase Bold or Emphasize. We use <strong> element to show that something is important and serious and we use <b> element to make the phrase bold.

#HTML LISTS
We have three tyoes of lists, the are Ordered lists, un-ordered lists and definition lists. Unorderd lits are used everyday, they are enclosed with <li> element that represent that they are a list item and they are wrapoed with <ul> element that shows that this is an unoedred list.
On orderd list we use <ol> to wrap the entire list which shows that the list is ordered.
Definition list it is used to create list that resembles a key-value. They use specific elements, a term is enclosed in a <dt> tag stands for definition term. The description term is enclosed in a <dd> tag which stands for definition description. The entire list s wrapped up by a <dl> tag which stand for a definiion list.

#HTML QOUTES
On qoutes we enclose the paragraph with a <p> tag and we then make the qoute differ or other text with <blockqoute> element that will wrap the entired thing.
We have <cite> and <blockqoute> elements that notify other computers about a additinal information.
On HTML we use <q> element which stands for qoute and the browser automatically provide the right qoute mark.The are also block-level elements.

DATE ELEMENT
HTML uses this element to to set date and time in a way that computers will understand. 
Syntax <time datetime="2024-01-12">January 12,2024</time>. Date and time have their specific format that machines can understand and as programmer we need to use them.

HTML DATE AND TIME INPUTS
HTML use this single element <time>, this element is used to mark anything that specifies time,date,day,and duration. The is also a closing tag </time>.
In between the tags we use a readable human format.
